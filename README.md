Hyperion Config File
====================

This is my personal config file for Hyperion.

It's designed for the use of a Lighpack-10leds combined with a R-pi model B.

To generate your Hyperion config file, use the configuration tool named HyperCon.
You can find it here: https://github.com/tvdzwan/hyperion/wiki/configuration

First, I wanted to use Boblight as mentioned on the website of the Lightpack project: lightpack.tv

To do so, I followed this tutorial: http://ajpawelski.wordpress.com/how-to-raspberry-pi-raspbmc-and-a-lightpack/

Boblight never worked, so I decided to follow Andrew Pawelski's advice and use Hyperion which works very well.
